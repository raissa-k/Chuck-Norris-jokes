## About
Just some practice with APIs. 

![Website view](img/dadnorrisdemo.gif)

Users can select the type of joke (or, ahem, fact) they want to generate through a toggle slider. Background image adjusts automatically as well.

The Chuck Norris jokes API allows the retrieval of a personalized joke from a previously specified category, too, so that gave me the idea for the little Easter Egg.

## Next steps?
- No further implementations predicted.
